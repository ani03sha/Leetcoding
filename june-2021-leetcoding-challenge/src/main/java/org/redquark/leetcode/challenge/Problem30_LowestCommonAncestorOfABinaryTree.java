 * <p>
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
 * p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant
 * of itself).
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
 * -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 * All Node.val are unique.
 * p != q
 * p and q will exist in the tree.
