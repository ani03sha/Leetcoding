 * <p>
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers
 * have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * <p>
 * This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
 * Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
