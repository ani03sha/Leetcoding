/**
 * @author Anirudh Sharma
 * <p>
 * Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design a system that suggests
 * at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed.
 * <p>
 * Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products
 * with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
 * <p>
 * Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= products.length <= 1000
 * There are no repeated elements in products.
 * 1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
 * All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
 * 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
 * All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
